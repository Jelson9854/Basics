Hello GitHub!

Scrum Questions: What I did? What I plan to do next? Any blockers I faced?

First Scrum Meeting with Shreyas Pawar for the Basics Docable
Shreyas Pawar - shreyaspawar@vt.edu

My answers: In class I worked on the docable file. I ran out of time in the git section, but I finished it shortly after class and set up my Basics repository. In the future I plan on completing the assignments in class if possible and uploading them to github. Lastly, my only blocker this week was my qualifier, but that is now finished and I can focus on this course.

Shreyas Answers: So far what Iâ€™ve done is basically covered the items in the workshop, which went pretty smoothly for me. I plan on covering up some more advanced shell commands to get comfortable with using the shell, and plan to use it more often than manually doing stuff. I faced one impediment of authentication failure on my local machine, but I was able to resolve it using the API token.
